    <h2>Paul Hulsebosch:</h2>
<p> I think it is a good game, it is just really violent. It could lead to real life crimes, because people see it in the game and want to try it themselfs</p>

    <h2>Juice and Spice</h2>
<p>In addition to the higher resolution, things like greater draw distance and the overall boost of detail make for an even richer and more beautiful world.

Jumping out of a plane and parachuting into the world beneath you is pure joy and you'll be amazed at the amount of juice and spice the men and women of Rockstar have managed to add to an old-gen game.

To throw in another bucket of technical gibberish: GTA V features dynamically adaptive depth of field, improved quality of the particle effects, modified and improved wind dynamics and weather systems, more realistic liquid elements such as blood, and the game counts three times the light sources than the old-gen versions.

All of this results in GTA V looking, again, droolingly beautiful for such a rich world with so much to do.</p>

    <h2>Jackass:</h2>
<p>Another fresh element in GTA V on PS4 and Xbox One is the first-person mode, which goes way beyond an extra camera angle. You can turn on the first-person mode in GTA V and in GTA Online with the push of a button (I haven't tested the online mode yet, so that you know that). However, because it has such a different feel, Rockstar has designed an optional first-person cover system, a new aiming system, more traditional FPS controls and over 3,000 additional animations. You can set the game up so that you sit in vehicles in third-person, for example, while on foot you do everything in first-person. In addition, you can also set the aiming completely to your own liking, and when you switch back to third-person, all the old settings of that mode are just saved. Playing from first person really offers a different experience. Experiencing the world of GTA V up, close and personal is, especially with the high-res graphics, very cool. In particular, the stunt racing over the roofs of houses and trains is so overwhelming that it made my heart beat ten times faster. The new cockpit mode is of course closely related to this and is especially enjoyable for the racing enthusiasts among us. You can play every vehicle in cockpit view and that gives a completely different experience to your GTA fix. The interiors of the cars and planes have been redone, including dashboards and the like. Gamers who normally always race from first-person will now be able to go wild. And of course the same applies to swimming, skydiving and so on. Ultimately, gamers will use this mode most during intense shootouts where the game plays more like a first-person shooter.</p>

    <h2>ScourgeBringer:</h2>
<p>Gta V fantastic, the level designs are outstanding, and battles are challenging and fun. If you enjoy Metroidvania games, don't hesitate trying it.

    <h2>Eurogamer:</h2>
<p>Gta V confirms on Switch all the good it displayed in its PC version: we're talking about one of the best (if not the best) metroidvania of recent years, graced by gorgeous art direction and a fantastic level of challenge. A must buy if you're not afraid of difficult titles.</p>

    <h2>IGN:</h2>
<p>Dark and beautiful, you’ll come for Gta’s visual appeal, but you’ll stay for the challenge and responsive combat.</p>
